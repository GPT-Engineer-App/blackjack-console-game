# blackjack-console-game

A CLI Blackjack game written in Python. The game should allow a single player to play against the dealer. The player can choose to hit, stand, or quit the game. Cards are dealt randomly, and the game checks for wins, losses, and ties based on traditional blackjack rules. The UI should be simple, using the console for inputs and outputs, guiding the player through each step of the game.
